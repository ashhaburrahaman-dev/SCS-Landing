- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to convey trust and friendliness.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Soft green (#A7D1AB) for a local, approachable, friendly, and nature-related feel. Also reflects 'support'.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a modern sans-serif, for both headlines and body text.
- Minimal, custom-designed icons representing each service offered. Icons should be in the accent color.
- Mobile-first, fully responsive layout. Use rounded cards and buttons with soft shadows to maintain a friendly and approachable design.
- Subtle animations (e.g., a smooth scroll to different sections, a small scaling animation on hover for buttons) to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
